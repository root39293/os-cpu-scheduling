# Overview

This project aims to implement CPU scheduling with JavaScript.

# Development Environment

- Language: JavaScript (ES6)
- Runtime: Node.js v14.17.0
- IDE: Visual Studio Code v1.56.2

# Implementation

In this project, we will implement several CPU scheduling techniques and analyze the test results. We will utilize Node.js within JavaScript to implement the program and analyze the results.

The scheduling algorithms I have chosen are

1. FCFS (First-Come First-Served)
2. Shortest Job first (SJF)
3. Round-Robin
4. . . .

```javascript
function FCFS(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // implementation code here
}
```
