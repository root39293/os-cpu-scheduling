# Overview

This project aims to implement CPU scheduling with JavaScript.

# Development Environment

- Language: JavaScript (ES6)
- Runtime: Node.js v14.17.0
- IDE: Visual Studio Code v1.56.2

# Implementation

In this project, we implement several CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), and Priority-based scheduling. We use JavaScript to write the implementation and Node.js to run the code. Here is an example of how the Round Robin algorithm is implemented:

```javascript
function SJF(processes, quantum) {
  // implementation code here
}
```
